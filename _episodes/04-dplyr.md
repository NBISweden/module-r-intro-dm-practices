# Data manipulation using **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**

Bracket subsetting is handy, but it can be cumbersome and difficult to read,
especially for complicated operations. **`dplyr`** is a package for making
tabular data manipulation easier. It pairs nicely with **`tidyr`** which enables
you to swiftly convert between different data formats for plotting and analysis.

The **`tidyverse`** package is an "umbrella-package" that installs **`tidyr`**,
**`dplyr`**, and several other packages useful for data analysis, such as 
**`ggplot2`**, **`tibble`**, etc.

The **`tidyverse`** package tries to address 3 common issues that arise when
doing data analysis with some of the functions that come with R:

1. The results from a base R function sometimes depend on the type of data.
2. Using R expressions in a non standard way, which can be confusing for new
   learners.
3. Hidden arguments, having default operations that new learners are not aware
   of.

You should already have installed and loaded the **`tidyverse`** package. 
If we haven't already done so, we can type `install.packages("tidyverse")`
straight into the console. Then, to load the package type `library(tidyverse)`.

## What are **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**?

The package **`dplyr`** provides easy tools for the most common data
manipulation tasks. It is built to work directly with data frames, with many
common tasks optimized by being written in a compiled language (C++). An
additional feature is the ability to work directly with data stored in an
external database. The benefits of doing this are that the data can be managed
natively in a relational database, queries can be conducted on that database,
and only the results of the query are returned.

This addresses a common problem with R in that all operations are conducted
in-memory and thus the amount of data you can work with is limited by available
memory. The database connections essentially remove this limitation in that you
can connect to a database of many hundreds of GB, conduct queries on it
directly, and pull back into R only what you need for analysis.

The package **`tidyr`** addresses the common problem of wanting to reshape your
data for plotting and use by different R functions. Sometimes we want data sets
where we have one row per measurement. Sometimes we want a data frame where each
measurement type has its own column, and rows are instead more aggregated groups
(e.g., a time period, an experimental unit like a plot or a batch number).
Moving back and forth between these formats is non-trivial, and **`tidyr`**
gives you tools for this and more sophisticated data manipulation.

To learn more about **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`** after the workshop, you may want
to check out this [handy data transformation with **`dplyr`** cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf)
and this [one about **`tidyr`**](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf).

In this episode, we will use the SARS-CoV-2 samples dataset that was introduced
in the previous episode. You can read the data using the `read_csv()` function
from the tidyverse package **`readr`**.


~~~
download.file(
  url = "https://nbisweden.github.io/module-r-intro-dm-practices/data/covid_samples.csv",
  destfile = "data_raw/covid_samples.csv")
~~~
{: .language-r}


~~~
## load the tidyverse packages, incl. dplyr
library(tidyverse)
~~~
{: .language-r}

We can then read the data into memory:


~~~
samples <- read_csv("data_raw/covid_samples.csv")
~~~
{: .language-r}

~~~
Rows: 29 Columns: 8
~~~
{: .output}



~~~

~~~

~~~
{: .output}

Like in the previous episode, we transform the columns `disease_outcome` and
`sex` into factors:


~~~
samples$disease_outcome <- factor(samples$disease_outcome)
samples$sex <- factor(samples$sex)
~~~
{: .language-r}


~~~
## inspect the data

## preview the data
view(samples)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Next, we're going to learn some of the most common **`dplyr`** functions:

- `select()`: subset columns
- `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
- `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other columns
- `group_by()` and `summarize()`: create summary statistics on grouped data
- `arrange()`: sort results
- `count()`: count discrete values

## Selecting columns and filtering rows

To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The first argument
to this function is the data frame (`samples`), and the subsequent
arguments are the columns to keep.


~~~
select(samples, patient_id, sex, ct)
~~~
{: .language-r}

To select all columns *except* certain ones, put a "-" in front of
the variable to exclude it.


~~~
select(samples, -collection_date, -country)
~~~
{: .language-r}

This will select all the variables in `samples` except `collection_date`
and `country`.

To choose rows based on a specific criterion, use `filter()`:


~~~
filter(samples, sex == "female")
~~~
{: .language-r}

## Pipes

What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three ways to
do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.

With intermediate steps, you create a temporary data frame and use that as input
to the next function, like this:


~~~
samples_female <- filter(samples, sex == "female")
samples_female_sml <- select(samples_female, patient_id, sex, ct)
~~~
{: .language-r}

This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of objects that
you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that can be hard to keep
track of.

You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another), like this:


~~~
samples_female <- select(
  filter(samples, sex == "female"), patient_id, sex, ct)
~~~
{: .language-r}

This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested, as
R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case, filtering, then
selecting).

The last option, *pipes*, are a recent addition to R. Pipes let you take the
output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful when
you need to do many things to the same dataset. Pipes in R look like `%>%` and
are made available via the **`magrittr`** package, installed automatically with
**`dplyr`**. If you use RStudio, you can type the pipe with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a PC or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> +
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a Mac.


~~~
samples %>%
  filter(sex == "female") %>%
  select(patient_id, sex, ct)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 16 × 3
   patient_id sex       ct
   <chr>      <fct>  <dbl>
 1 OAS-29_1   female  41.5
 2 OAS-29_12  female  27  
 3 OAS-29_13  female  25.3
 4 OAS-29_15  female  33.7
 5 OAS-29_17  female  35.7
 6 OAS-29_18  female  19.3
 7 OAS-29_19  female  26.7
 8 OAS-29_2   female  37  
 9 OAS-29_22  female  28.3
10 OAS-29_25  female  30.7
11 OAS-29_26  female  36.7
12 OAS-29_28  female  37.5
13 OAS-29_3   female  39  
14 OAS-29_6   female  30  
15 OAS-29_8   female  30  
16 OAS-29_9   female  18.3
~~~
{: .output}

In the above code, we use the pipe to send the `samples` dataset first through
`filter()` to keep rows where `sex` equals `"female"`, then through `select()`
to keep only the `patient_id`, `sex`, and `ct` columns. Since `%>%` takes the
object on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on its
right, we don't need to explicitly include the data frame as an argument to the
`filter()` and `select()` functions any more.

Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word "then". For instance,
in the above example, we took the data frame `samples`, *then* we `filter`ed for
rows with `sex == "female"`, *then* we `select`ed columns `patient_id`, `sex`,
and `ct`. The **`dplyr`** functions by themselves are somewhat simple, but by
combining them into linear workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish more
complex manipulations of data frames.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data, we
can assign it a new name:


~~~
samples_female <- samples %>%
  filter(sex == "female") %>%
  select(patient_id, sex, ct)

samples_female
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 16 × 3
   patient_id sex       ct
   <chr>      <fct>  <dbl>
 1 OAS-29_1   female  41.5
 2 OAS-29_12  female  27  
 3 OAS-29_13  female  25.3
 4 OAS-29_15  female  33.7
 5 OAS-29_17  female  35.7
 6 OAS-29_18  female  19.3
 7 OAS-29_19  female  26.7
 8 OAS-29_2   female  37  
 9 OAS-29_22  female  28.3
10 OAS-29_25  female  30.7
11 OAS-29_26  female  36.7
12 OAS-29_28  female  37.5
13 OAS-29_3   female  39  
14 OAS-29_6   female  30  
15 OAS-29_8   female  30  
16 OAS-29_9   female  18.3
~~~
{: .output}

Note that the final data frame is the leftmost part of this expression.

### Split-apply-combine data analysis and the `summarize()` function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the *split-apply-combine*
paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and
then combine the results. **`dplyr`** makes this very easy through the use of
the `group_by()` function.


#### The `summarize()` function

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()`, which collapses each
group into a single-row summary of that group. `group_by()` takes as arguments
the column names that contain the **categorical** variables for which you want
to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute the mean `ct` value by sex:


~~~
samples %>%
  group_by(disease_outcome) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(ct))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 3 × 2
  disease_outcome  mean
  <fct>           <dbl>
1 dead             28.9
2 recovered        28.6
3 <NA>             31.7
~~~
{: .output}

You can also group by multiple columns:


~~~
samples %>%
  group_by(disease_outcome, sex) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(ct))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 6 × 3
# Groups:   disease_outcome [3]
  disease_outcome sex     mean
  <fct>           <fct>  <dbl>
1 dead            female  31.5
2 dead            male    25.1
3 recovered       female  29.4
4 recovered       male    27.7
5 <NA>            female  36.7
6 <NA>            male    29.2
~~~
{: .output}

Once the data are grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at the same
time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance, we could add a
column indicating the minimum Ct value for each disease outcome for each sex:


~~~
samples %>%
  group_by(disease_outcome, sex) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(ct),
            min = min(ct))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 6 × 4
# Groups:   disease_outcome [3]
  disease_outcome sex     mean   min
  <fct>           <fct>  <dbl> <dbl>
1 dead            female  31.5  18.3
2 dead            male    25.1  16  
3 recovered       female  29.4  19.3
4 recovered       male    27.7  16.3
5 <NA>            female  36.7  36.7
6 <NA>            male    29.2  15.3
~~~
{: .output}

It is sometimes useful to rearrange the result of a query to inspect the values.
For instance, we can sort on `min` to put the lowest numbers first:


~~~
samples %>%
  group_by(disease_outcome, sex) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(ct),
            min = min(ct)) %>%
  arrange(min)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 6 × 4
# Groups:   disease_outcome [3]
  disease_outcome sex     mean   min
  <fct>           <fct>  <dbl> <dbl>
1 <NA>            male    29.2  15.3
2 dead            male    25.1  16  
3 recovered       male    27.7  16.3
4 dead            female  31.5  18.3
5 recovered       female  29.4  19.3
6 <NA>            female  36.7  36.7
~~~
{: .output}

To sort in descending order, we need to add the `desc()` function. If we want
to sort the results by decreasing order of mean Ct:


~~~
samples %>%
  group_by(disease_outcome, sex) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(ct),
            min = min(ct)) %>%
  arrange(desc(min))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 6 × 4
# Groups:   disease_outcome [3]
  disease_outcome sex     mean   min
  <fct>           <fct>  <dbl> <dbl>
1 <NA>            female  36.7  36.7
2 recovered       female  29.4  19.3
3 dead            female  31.5  18.3
4 recovered       male    27.7  16.3
5 dead            male    25.1  16  
6 <NA>            male    29.2  15.3
~~~
{: .output}

#### Counting

When working with data, we often want to know the number of observations found
for each factor or combination of factors. For this task, **`dplyr`** provides
`count()`. For example, if we wanted to count the number of rows of data for
each sample, we would do:


~~~
samples %>%
  count(disease_outcome) 
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 3 × 2
  disease_outcome     n
  <fct>           <int>
1 dead               15
2 recovered          11
3 <NA>                3
~~~
{: .output}

The `count()` function is shorthand for something we've already seen: grouping
by a variable, and summarizing it by counting the number of observations in that
group. In other words, `samples %>% count(disease_outcome)` is equivalent to:  


~~~
samples %>%
  group_by(disease_outcome) %>%
  summarize(n = n())
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 3 × 2
  disease_outcome     n
  <fct>           <int>
1 dead               15
2 recovered          11
3 <NA>                3
~~~
{: .output}

We can also combine `count()` with other functions such as `filter()`. Here
we will count the disease outcomes for only the samples with high Ct values,
i.e. with a Ct value greater than or equal to 35.


~~~
samples %>%
  filter(ct >= 35) %>%
  count(disease_outcome) 
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 3 × 2
  disease_outcome     n
  <fct>           <int>
1 dead                5
2 recovered           3
3 <NA>                2
~~~
{: .output}

The example above shows the use of `count()` to count the number of
rows/observations for *one* factor (i.e., `disease_outcome`). If we wanted to
count *combination of factors*, such as `disease_outcome` and `sex`, we would
specify the first and the second factor as the arguments of `count()`:


~~~
samples %>%
  filter(ct >= 35) %>%
  count(disease_outcome, sex) 
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 6 × 3
  disease_outcome sex        n
  <fct>           <fct>  <int>
1 dead            female     4
2 dead            male       1
3 recovered       female     1
4 recovered       male       2
5 <NA>            female     1
6 <NA>            male       1
~~~
{: .output}

With the above code, we can proceed with `arrange()` to sort the table according
to a number of criteria so that we have a better comparison. For instance, we
might want to arrange the table above in (i) an alphabetical order of the levels
of the sex and (ii) in descending order of the count:


~~~
samples %>%
  filter(ct >= 35) %>%
  count(disease_outcome, sex)  %>%
  arrange(sex, desc(n))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 6 × 3
  disease_outcome sex        n
  <fct>           <fct>  <int>

From the table above, we may learn that, for instance, there are one female and
one male where the disease outcome is not specified (i.e. `NA`).

# Exporting data

Now that you have learned how to use **`dplyr`** to extract information from
or summarize your raw data, you may want to export these new data sets to share
them with your collaborators or for archival.

Similar to the `read_csv()` function used for reading CSV files into R, there is
a `write_csv()` function that generates CSV files from data frames.

Before using `write_csv()`, we are going to create a new folder, `data`, in our
working directory that will store this generated dataset. We don't want to write
generated datasets in the same directory as our raw data. It's good practice to
keep them separate. The `data_raw` folder should only contain the raw, unaltered
data, and should be left alone to make sure we don't delete or modify it. In
contrast, our script will generate the contents of the `data` directory, so even
if the files it contains are deleted, we can always re-generate them.

We will conclude this episode by generating a CSV file with a small dataset
that contain only samples with a Ct value greater than or equal to 35:


~~~
# Filter out samples with high Ct values
samples_high_ct <- samples %>%
  filter(ct >= 35)

# Write data frame to CSV
write_csv(samples_high_ct, file = "data/samples_high_ct.csv")
~~~
