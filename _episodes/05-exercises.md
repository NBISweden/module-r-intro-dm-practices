## 1. First steps in R

> ## Challenge 1.1
>
> What are the values after each statement in the following?
>
> 
> ~~~
> mass <- 47.5            # mass?
> age  <- 122             # age?
> mass <- mass * 2.0      # mass?
> age  <- age - 20        # age?
> mass_index <- mass/age  # mass_index?

> ## Challenge 1.2
>
> * We’ve seen that atomic vectors can be of type character, numeric (or
>   double), integer, and logical. But what happens if we try to mix these types
>   in a single vector?
> 
>> ## Answer
>>
>> R implicitly converts them all to be the same type.
> {: .solution}
>
> * What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use `class()` to check
>   the data type of your objects):
>
>     ```r
>     num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
>     num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
>     char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
>     tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
>     ```
>
> * Why do you think it happens?
>
>> ## Answer
>>
>> Vectors can be of only one data type. R tries to convert (coerce) the content
>> of this vector to find a "common denominator" that doesn't lose any
>> information.
> {: .solution}
>
> * How many values in `combined_logical` are `"TRUE"` (as a character) in the
>   following example (reusing the 2 `..._logical`s from above):
>
>     ```r
>     combined_logical <- c(num_logical, char_logical)
>     ```
>
>> ## Answer
>>
>> Only one. There is no memory of past data types, and the coercion happens the
>> first time the vector is evaluated. Therefore, the `TRUE` in `num_logical`
>> gets converted into a `1` before it gets converted into `"1"` in
>> `combined_logical`.
> {: .solution}
>
> * You've probably noticed that objects of different types get
>   converted into a single, shared type within a vector. In R, we
>   call converting objects from one class into another class
>   _coercion_. These conversions happen according to a hierarchy,
>   whereby some types get preferentially coerced into other
>   types. Can you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of how
>   these data types are coerced?
>
>> ## Answer
>>
>> logical &#8594; numeric &#8594; character &#8592; logical
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Challenge 1.3 (optional)
>
> * Can you figure out why `"four" > "five"` returns `TRUE`?
> 
>> ## Answer
>>
>> When using ">" or "<" on strings, R compares their alphabetical order. 
>> Here "four" comes after "five", and therefore is "greater than" it.

> ## Challenge 1.4
>
> 1. Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector,
>    `heights_no_na`, with the NAs removed.
>
>     ```r
>     heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)
>     ```
> 2. Use the function `median()` to calculate the median of the `heights` vector.
>
> 3. Use R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.

## 2. Starting with data

### Loading the samples data


~~~
download.file(
  url = "https://nbisweden.github.io/module-r-intro-dm-practices/data/Hawks.csv",
  destfile = "data_raw/Hawks.csv"
)
~~~
{: .language-r}


~~~
## load the tidyverse packages, incl. dplyr
library(tidyverse)
~~~
{: .language-r}


~~~
hawks <- read_csv("data_raw/Hawks.csv")
~~~
{: .language-r}


### Inspecting data frames

* Size:
    * `dim(hawks)` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element,
          and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of
          the object)
    * `nrow(hawks)` - returns the number of rows
    * `ncol(hawks)` - returns the number of columns

* Content:
    * `head(hawks)` - shows the first 6 rows
    * `tail(hawks)` - shows the last 6 rows

* Names:
    * `names(hawks)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for `data.frame`
	   objects)
    * `rownames(hawks)` - returns the row names

* Summary:
    * `str(hawks)` - structure of the object and information about the class, length and
	   content of  each column
    * `summary(hawks)` - summary statistics for each column

Note: most of these functions are "generic", they can be used on other types of
objects besides `data.frame`.


### Challenges

> ## Challenge 2.1
>
> Based on the output of `str(hawks)`, can you answer the following questions?

> ## Challenge 2.2
>
> 1. Create a `data.frame` (`hawks_20`) containing only the data in
>    row 20 of the `hawks` dataset.
>
> 2. Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in a `data.frame`?
>
>      * Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame.
>      * Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make
>        sure it's meeting expectations.
>      * Pull out that last row using `nrow()` instead of the row number.
>      * Create a new data frame (`hawks_last`) from that last row.
>
> 3. Combine `nrow()` with the `-` notation above to reproduce the behavior of
>    `head(hawks)`, keeping just the first 6 rows of the hawks

>
> 1. We have seen how data frames are created when using `read_csv()`, but they

>    few mistakes in this hand-crafted `data.frame`. Can you spot and fix them?

## 3. Manipulating, analyzing and exporting data with tidyverse


### Useful `dplyr` functions

- `select()`: subset columns
- `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
- `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other columns
- `group_by()` and `summarize()`: create summary statistics on grouped data
- `arrange()`: sort results
- `count()`: count discrete values

### Challenges

> (column `Weight`) greater than 500 g, and retain only the columns
> `Species` and `Weight`.

> ## Challenge 4.5
>
> With all of this information in hand, please take another five minutes to either
> improve one of the plots generated in this exercise or create a beautiful graph
> of your own. Use the RStudio [**`ggplot2`** cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) 
> for inspiration.
>
> Here are some ideas:
>
> * See if you can change the thickness of the lines.
> * Can you find a way to change the name of the legend?
> * Try using a different color palette (see
>   [http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/)).
