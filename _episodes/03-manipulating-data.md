# Data manipulation using **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**

Bracket subsetting is handy, but it can be cumbersome and difficult to read,
especially for complicated operations. **`dplyr`** is a package for making
tabular data manipulation easier. It pairs nicely with **`tidyr`** which enables
you to swiftly convert between different data formats for plotting and analysis.

The **`tidyverse`** package is an "umbrella-package" that installs **`tidyr`**,
**`dplyr`**, and several other packages useful for data analysis, such as 
**`ggplot2`**, **`tibble`**, etc.

The **`tidyverse`** package tries to address 3 common issues that arise when
doing data analysis with some of the functions that come with R:

1. The results from a base R function sometimes depend on the type of data.
2. Using R expressions in a non standard way, which can be confusing for new
   learners.
3. Hidden arguments, having default operations that new learners are not aware
   of.

You should already have installed and loaded the **`tidyverse`** package. 
If we haven't already done so, we can type `install.packages("tidyverse")`
straight into the console. Then, to load the package type `library(tidyverse)`.

## What are **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**?

The package **`dplyr`** provides easy tools for the most common data
manipulation tasks. It is built to work directly with data frames, with many
common tasks optimized by being written in a compiled language (C++). An
additional feature is the ability to work directly with data stored in an
external database. The benefits of doing this are that the data can be managed
natively in a relational database, queries can be conducted on that database,
and only the results of the query are returned.

This addresses a common problem with R in that all operations are conducted
in-memory and thus the amount of data you can work with is limited by available
memory. The database connections essentially remove this limitation in that you
can connect to a database of many hundreds of GB, conduct queries on it
directly, and pull back into R only what you need for analysis.

The package **`tidyr`** addresses the common problem of wanting to reshape your
data for plotting and use by different R functions. Sometimes we want data sets
where we have one row per measurement. Sometimes we want a data frame where each
measurement type has its own column, and rows are instead more aggregated groups
(e.g., a time period, an experimental unit like a plot or a batch number).
Moving back and forth between these formats is non-trivial, and **`tidyr`**
gives you tools for this and more sophisticated data manipulation.

To learn more about **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`** after the workshop, you may want
to check out this [handy data transformation with **`dplyr`** cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-transformation.pdf)
and this [one about **`tidyr`**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-import.pdf).

As before, we'll read in our data using the `read_csv()` function from the 
tidyverse package **`readr`**.

Next, we're going to learn some of the most common **`dplyr`** functions:

- `select()`: subset columns
- `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
- `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other columns
- `group_by()` and `summarize()`: create summary statistics on grouped data
- `arrange()`: sort results
- `count()`: count discrete values

## Selecting columns and filtering rows

To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The first argument
to this function is the data frame (`hawks`), and the subsequent
arguments are the columns to keep.


~~~
select(hawks, Species, Sex, Weight)
~~~
{: .language-r}

To select all columns *except* certain ones, put a "-" in front of
the variable to exclude it.


~~~
select(hawks, -BandNumber, -Culmen)
~~~
{: .language-r}

This will select all the variables in `hawks` except `BandNumber`
and `Culmen`.

To choose rows based on a specific criterion, use `filter()`:


~~~
filter(hawks, Sex == "F")
~~~
{: .language-r}

We can also filter rows that do not contain missing data in some columns:

~~~
{: .output}

This will return all rows that have a value in both the `Sex` column and the
`Weight` column. In **`Tidyverse`**, there is also a special functions `drop_na` 
that can be used to filter out rows with missing data:


~~~
drop_na(hawks, Sex, Weight)

## Pipes

What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three ways to
do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.

With intermediate steps, you create a temporary data frame and use that as input
to the next function, like this:


~~~
hawks_female <- filter(hawks, Sex == "F")
hawks_female_sml <- select(hawks_female, Species, Sex, Weight)
~~~
{: .language-r}

This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of objects that
you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that can be hard to keep
track of.

You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another), like this:


~~~
hawks_female <- select(
  filter(hawks, Sex == "F"), Species, Sex, Weight)
~~~
{: .language-r}

This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested, as
R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case, filtering, then
selecting).

The last option, *pipes*, are a recent addition to R. Pipes let you take the
output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful when
you need to do many things to the same dataset. Pipes in R look like `%>%` and
are made available via the **`magrittr`** package, installed automatically with
**`dplyr`**. If you use RStudio, you can type the pipe with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a PC or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> +
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a Mac.


~~~
hawks %>%
  filter(Sex == "F") %>%
  select(Species, Sex, Weight)

# A tibble: 174 × 3
   Species Sex   Weight
   <chr>   <chr>  <dbl>
 1 CH      F        470
 2 SS      F        170
 3 SS      F        180
 4 SS      F        134

10 SS      F        168
# ℹ 164 more rows
~~~
{: .output}

In the above code, we use the pipe to send the `hawks` dataset first through
`filter()` to keep rows where `Sex` equals `"F"`, then through `select()`
to keep only the `Species`, `Sex`, and `Weight` columns. Since `%>%` takes the
object on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on its
right, we don't need to explicitly include the data frame as an argument to the
`filter()` and `select()` functions any more.

Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word "then". For instance,
in the above example, we took the data frame `hawks`, *then* we `filter`ed for
rows with `Sex == "F"`, *then* we `select`ed columns `Species`, `Sex`,
and `Weight`. The **`dplyr`** functions by themselves are somewhat simple, but by
combining them into linear workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish more
complex manipulations of data frames.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data, we
can assign it a new name:


~~~
hawks_female <- hawks %>%
  filter(Sex == "F") %>%
  select(Species, Sex, Weight)

hawks_female
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 174 × 3

 4 SS      F        134

### Mutate


Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing
columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the ratio of values in two
columns. For this we'll use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of weight in kg:


~~~
hawks %>%
  mutate(Weight_kg = Weight / 1000)

If this runs off your screen and you just want to see the first few rows, you
can use a pipe to view the `head()` of the data. (Pipes work with non-**`dplyr`**

`is.na()` is a function that determines whether something is an `NA`. The `!`
symbol negates the result, so we're asking for every row where weight *is not* an `NA`.

### Creating your own functions

Although there are many functions provided by R and its third-party packages,
situations often arise when it is useful to write custom functions. Functions
allow you automate common tasks and reduces the risk that you introduce errors
in your code. If you find yourself copying and pasting the same block of code
multiple times, you should consider wrapping that code block inside a function.

Let's create a function for converting weight in kilograms to pounds:


~~~
kg_to_lb <- function(x) {
  lb  <-  x * 2.20462262
  return(lb)
}
~~~
{: .language-r}

We define kg_to_lb by assigning it to the output of function. The list of 
argument names are contained within parentheses. Next, the body of the 
function – the statements that are executed when it runs – is contained within 
curly braces ({}). The statements in the body are indented by two spaces, which 
makes the code easier to read but does not affect how the code operates.

When we call the function, the values we pass to it are assigned to those
variables so that we can use them inside the function. Inside the function, we
use a return statement to send a result back to whoever asked for it.

> ## Automatic Returns
>
> In R, it is not necessary to include the return statement. R automatically
> returns whichever variable is on the last line of the body of the function.
> While in the learning phase, we will explicitly define the
> return statement.
{: .callout}

Let's try running our function. Calling our own function is no different from
calling any other function:


~~~
# Convert a single value
kg_to_lb(57.5)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 126.7658
~~~

~~~

### Split-apply-combine data analysis and the `summarize()` function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the *split-apply-combine*
paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and
then combine the results. **`dplyr`** makes this very easy through the use of
the `group_by()` function.


#### The `summarize()` function

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()`, which collapses each
group into a single-row summary of that group. `group_by()` takes as arguments
the column names that contain the **categorical** variables for which you want
to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute the mean weight by sex:


~~~
hawks %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(Weight, na.rm = TRUE))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 3 × 2
  Sex    mean
  <chr> <dbl>
1 F      257.
2 M      174.
3 <NA>  1090.
~~~
{: .output}

The argument `na.rm` is used to exclude `NA` values before computing the mean.

You can also group by multiple columns:


~~~
hawks %>%
  group_by(Species, Sex) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(Weight, na.rm = TRUE))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 9 × 3
# Groups:   Species [3]
  Species Sex    mean
  <chr>   <chr> <dbl>
1 CH      F      490.
2 CH      M      348.
3 CH      <NA>   402 
4 RT      F     1147.
5 RT      M     1080 
6 RT      <NA>  1094.
7 SS      F      175.
8 SS      M      119.
9 SS      <NA>    95 
~~~
{: .output}

Once the data are grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at the same
time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance, we could add a
column indicating the minimum weight for each species for each sex:


~~~
hawks %>%
  group_by(Species, Sex) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(Weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            min = min(Weight, na.rm = TRUE))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 9 × 4
# Groups:   Species [3]
  Species Sex    mean   min
  <chr>   <chr> <dbl> <dbl>
1 CH      F      490.    56
2 CH      M      348.   155
3 CH      <NA>   402    324
4 RT      F     1147.  1120
5 RT      M     1080   1080
6 RT      <NA>  1094.   101
7 SS      F      175.    92
8 SS      M      119.    85
9 SS      <NA>    95     95
~~~
{: .output}

It is sometimes useful to rearrange the result of a query to inspect the values.
For instance, we can sort on `min` to put the lowest numbers first:


~~~
hawks %>%
  group_by(Species, Sex) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(Weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            min = min(Weight, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(min)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 9 × 4
# Groups:   Species [3]
  Species Sex    mean   min
  <chr>   <chr> <dbl> <dbl>
1 CH      F      490.    56
2 SS      M      119.    85
3 SS      F      175.    92
4 SS      <NA>    95     95
5 RT      <NA>  1094.   101
6 CH      M      348.   155
7 CH      <NA>   402    324
8 RT      M     1080   1080
9 RT      F     1147.  1120
~~~
{: .output}

To sort in descending order, we need to add the `desc()` function. If we want
to sort the results by decreasing order of mean weight:


~~~
hawks %>%
  group_by(Species, Sex) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(Weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            min = min(Weight, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(min) %>% 
  arrange(desc(min))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 9 × 4
# Groups:   Species [3]
  Species Sex    mean   min
  <chr>   <chr> <dbl> <dbl>
1 RT      F     1147.  1120
2 RT      M     1080   1080
3 CH      <NA>   402    324
4 CH      M      348.   155
5 RT      <NA>  1094.   101
6 SS      <NA>    95     95
7 SS      F      175.    92
8 SS      M      119.    85
9 CH      F      490.    56
~~~
{: .output}

#### Counting

When working with data, we often want to know the number of observations found
for each factor or combination of factors. For this task, **`dplyr`** provides
`count()`. For example, if we wanted to count the number of rows of data for
each Sex, we would do:


~~~
hawks %>%
  count(Sex) 
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 3 × 2
  Sex       n
  <chr> <int>
1 F       174
2 M       158
3 <NA>    576
~~~
{: .output}

The `count()` function is shorthand for something we've already seen: grouping
by a variable, and summarizing it by counting the number of observations in that
group. In other words, `hawks %>% count(Sex)` is equivalent to:  


~~~
hawks %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>%
  summarize(n = n())
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 3 × 2
  Sex       n
  <chr> <int>
1 F       174
2 M       158
3 <NA>    576
~~~
{: .output}

We can also combine `count()` with other functions such as `filter()`. Here
we will count the number of each species with weights above 800 g.


~~~
hawks %>%
  filter(Weight > 500) %>%
  count(Species)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 3 × 2
  Species     n
  <chr>   <int>
1 CH         19
2 RT        566
3 SS          2
~~~
{: .output}

The example above shows the use of `count()` to count the number of
rows/observations for *one* factor (i.e., `Species`). If we wanted to
count *combination of factors*, such as `Species` and `Sex`, we would
specify the first and the second factor as the arguments of `count()`:


~~~
hawks %>%
  filter(Weight > 500) %>%
  count(Species, Sex)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 6 × 3
  Species Sex       n
  <chr>   <chr> <int>
1 CH      F        17
2 CH      M         2
3 RT      F         3
4 RT      M         1
5 RT      <NA>    562
6 SS      M         2
~~~
{: .output}

With the above code, we can proceed with `arrange()` to sort the table according
to a number of criteria so that we have a better comparison. For instance, we
might want to arrange the table above in (i) an alphabetical order of the levels
of the sex and (ii) in descending order of the count:


~~~
hawks %>%
  filter(Weight > 500) %>%
  count(Species, Sex) %>% 
  arrange(Sex, desc(n))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 6 × 3
  Species Sex       n
  <chr>   <chr> <int>
1 CH      F        17
2 RT      F         3
3 CH      M         2
4 SS      M         2
5 RT      M         1
6 RT      <NA>    562

# Exporting data

Now that you have learned how to use **`dplyr`** to extract information from
or summarize your raw data, you may want to export these new data sets to share
them with your collaborators or for archival.

Similar to the `read_csv()` function used for reading CSV files into R, there is
a `write_csv()` function that generates CSV files from data frames.

Before using `write_csv()`, we are going to create a new folder, `data`, in our
working directory that will store this generated dataset. We don't want to write
generated datasets in the same directory as our raw data. It's good practice to
keep them separate. The `data_raw` folder should only contain the raw, unaltered
data, and should be left alone to make sure we don't delete or modify it. In
contrast, our script will generate the contents of the `data` directory, so even
if the files it contains are deleted, we can always re-generate them.

We will conclude this episode by generating a CSV file with a small dataset
that contain only measurements for Red-tailed hawk females:


~~~
# Filter out observations
hawks_rt_f <- hawks %>% 
  filter(Species == "RT" & Sex == "F")

# Write data frame to CSV
write_csv(hawks_rt_f, file = "data_processed/Hawks_Red-Tailed_female.csv")
~~~
{: .language-r}
